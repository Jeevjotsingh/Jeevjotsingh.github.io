                Digital currency is a form of money that exists only in electronic form. Unlike physical cash, it is transacted 
                digitally through computer networks. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) 
                are examples of digital currencies. They offer faster transactions, lower costs, and increased security, but also 
                present challenges such as volatility and regulatory concerns.
